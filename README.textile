h1. Cycle.vim

A vim plugin that allows you to toggle between pairs or lists of related words. The
default mappings are the same as those with which you can increment and decrement
a number under the cursor: <code><C-A></code> and <code><C-X></code>, respectively.

h2. Customization

You can add your own word groups:

<pre><code>
  call AddCycleGroup(['one', 'two', 'three'])
</code></pre>

To deal with conflicts, Cycle.vim also supports adding groups that are specific
to a certain filetype:

<pre><code>
  call AddCycleGroup('ruby', ['class', 'module'])
  call AddCycleGroup('python', ['else', 'elif'])
</code></pre>

When multiple groups define the same word, groups belonging to specific
filetypes will be used instead of global groups. This is useful in the cases
above, since in HTML we would want 'class' to cycle with 'id' and Python uses
'elif' while some other languages use 'elsif'.

Providing a list of filetypes is also supported:

<pre><code>
  call AddCycleGroup(['ruby', 'eruby', 'perl'], ['else', 'elsif'])
</code></pre>

However, if there are no conflicting cases it is preferable to define all
cycle groups in the global namespace, using filetype-specific groups only in
case of conflict. Instead of specifying multiple languages we define that
group in the global space and override it only for python.

h2. Todo

# The ability to handle pairs: quotes, brackets, html tags, etc.
# Operate on non-lowercase text and retain case
# Allow work on substrings - 8px, 8%, 8em
# Put cursor back at beginning of word if it started there

h2. Bugs

# Does not work with speeddating.vim - currently won't work if speeddating is installed.
# Calling Cycle from whitespace before a matching word does not behave well.
